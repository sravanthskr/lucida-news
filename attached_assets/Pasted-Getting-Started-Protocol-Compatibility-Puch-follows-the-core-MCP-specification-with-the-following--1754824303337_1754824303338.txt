Quick Setup Guide
1
Prepare Your MCP Server
Ensure your MCP server is publicly accessible and serving over HTTPS.

2
Connect from Puch Chat
Use the /mcp connect command in any Puch conversation.

3
Verify Connection
Puch will confirm successful connection and show available tools, or display error messages for troubleshooting.

Command Reference
Connect with Bearer Token
/mcp connect <url> <bearer_token>
Connect your MCP server with Puch AI. Your MCP server must have a validate tool that accepts the bearer token and returns the user's phone number in the format {country_code}{number} (e.g., 919876543210 for +91-9876543210). This validation is required for authentication.
Example: /mcp connect https://mcp.example.com/mcp abc123token

The validate tool must return the user's phone number when given the bearer token for authentication to succeed.
Connect with OAuth
/mcp connect <url>
For servers supporting OAuth authentication. A browser window may open for consent and authentication.
Use a hosted MCP server
/mcp use <server_id>
Connect to a hosted MCP server using its unique identifier. You can connect upto 5 MCP servers at a time.
Remove a server
/mcp remove <server_id>
Remove a hosted MCP server from your list of connected servers.
List connected servers
/mcp list
List all your MCP server configurations
Disconnect Server
/mcp deactivate
Safely disconnect from all currently active MCP servers. This will remove access to all server-provided tools.
Set Diagnostic Level
/mcp diagnostics-level (error|warn|info|debug)
Control the amount of diagnostic information you receive from MCP operations.
Available levels: error, warn, info, debug
Disable a server
/mcp disable <server_id>
Disable a specific MCP server. You will still be connected to the server but you won't be able to use its tools.
This is mostly for debugging. You can re-enable the server later using the /mcp enable command.
Enable a server
/mcp enable <server_id>
Enable a specific MCP server. By default, the server you connected to will be enabled.
MCP Server Requirements
Validate Tool
Your MCP server must have a validate tool that returns the server owner's phone number in the format:

{country_code}{number}
Example: 919876543210 for +91-9876543210

HTTPS Requirement
All endpoints must be served over HTTPS for security. HTTP connections will be rejected.

Prepare for production
Before sharing your server, deploy it on a hosting platform such as Vercel, Cloudflare, or any other service. Ensure that the server is publicly accessible so others can connect to it.
