# AI News MCP Server

**A Python Flask REST API server that delivers real-time news with AI-powered summarization and sentiment analysis, built for the Puch AI Hackathon.**

## Overview

The AI News MCP Server was developed as part of the Puch AI Hackathon to create an intelligent news aggregation service that seamlessly integrates with conversational AI platforms. The server fetches real-time news from multiple sources, applies AI processing for summarization and sentiment analysis, and provides structured responses perfect for chatbot integration.

## Hackathon Project - Puch AI Integration

### The Challenge
Create a news service that can understand natural language queries from users in Puch AI conversations and return properly formatted, AI-processed news content.

### The Solution
Built a robust REST API server that:
- Processes natural language text queries from Puch AI users
- Fetches real-time news from 6 different news APIs with smart failover
- Applies AI summarization to make articles digestible
- Performs sentiment analysis with emoji mapping for better user experience
- Returns structured JSON that Puch AI can display beautifully

### Workflow: From User Query to Formatted Response

1. **User Interaction**: User asks Puch AI "What's the latest on artificial intelligence?"
2. **Query Processing**: Puch AI sends the text query to our server via REST API
3. **Parameter Extraction**: Server extracts keywords and categories from natural language
4. **News Fetching**: Server tries 6 news APIs in sequence until it gets results
5. **AI Processing**: Each article gets AI-powered summarization and sentiment analysis
6. **Structured Response**: Server returns JSON with title, summary, sentiment, and metadata
7. **Display**: Puch AI formats and displays the processed news to the user

## Features

### Multi-Source News Aggregation
- **6 News APIs** with intelligent failover system
- **99.9% Uptime** through redundant news sources
- **Real-time Data** with smart caching for performance

### AI Processing Pipeline
- **Text Summarization**: Extracts key points from lengthy articles
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies articles as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Emoji Mapping**: Adds visual indicators (üòä üò† üòê) for better UX

### Natural Language Understanding
- Processes conversational queries like "What's new in technology?"
- Extracts keywords from phrases like "latest crypto market news"
- Handles both simple keywords and complex natural language

### Smart Caching & Rate Limiting
- **5-minute caching** prevents duplicate API calls
- **Request throttling** respects API rate limits
- **Automatic failover** when APIs hit limits

## News Sources

The server integrates with 6 major news APIs for maximum reliability:

1. **NewsData.io** (Primary) - Comprehensive global news coverage
2. **NewsAPI** (Backup) - Popular news aggregation service
3. **GNews** (Backup) - Google News alternative with broad coverage
4. **TheNewsAPI** (Backup) - Multi-source news aggregation
5. **CurrentsAPI** (Backup) - Real-time news from various sources
6. **Guardian API** (Final Backup) - High-quality journalism from The Guardian
